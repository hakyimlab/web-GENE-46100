# TF Binding Prediction Challenge

## Overview
- **Goal**: Predict transcription factor (TF) binding scores in DNA sequences
- **Input**: 300bp human DNA sequences
- **Target**: Binding scores for transcription factors

## Data Description
The challenge uses real genomic data to predict TF binding scores:

- **Sequence Data**: `chr#_sequences.txt.gz` files containing 300bp DNA sequences
  - Each sequence has a unique identifier in format `chr#_start_end`
  
- **Target Data**: `chr#_scores.txt.gz` files containing binding scores
  - Each sequence has a corresponding 300-long vector of binding scores
  - Scores are predicted using [Homer](http://homer.ucsd.edu/homer/motif/index.html), a widely used motif discovery tool
  - Each position in the vector represents the binding score at that position in the sequence

## Getting Started
- [Data download link](https://uchicago.box.com/s/eajhnujlaxnd5441sv3dt73pfoxvgh4l)
- [Starter notebook](tf-binding-prediction-starter.ipynb)
- [Example implementation]()

## Timeline
- **Training Sessions**:
  - Tuesday, April 8: Sofia will review implementation of using the code in the basic DNA scoring model. Students will continue working on the project. Charles, Sofia, and Ran will be available to help.
  - Thursday, April 10: Sofia will explain how to use **weights and biases** to calibrate hyperparameters of the model (learning rate, number of filters, kernel size, etc). Charles, Sofia, Ran, and Haky will be available to help.

- **Presentation Day** (Thursday, April 10):
  Students will present:
  - Model architecture
  - Model performance
  - Filter interpretation (time permitting)
  - Lessons learned

- **Submission Deadline**: April 18
  - Submit best model to Canvas
  - TA will test on held-out data
  - Leaderboard will be created
