# Homework 3

## Part 1: Hyperparameter Calibration with Weights & Biases
- [ ] Implement hyperparameter tuning using Weights & Biases (wandb)
- [ ] Choose one of the following problems to apply this to:
  - TF binding prediction
  - Simple DNA scoring
  - Cubic function with MLP
- [ ] Reference example: [TF Binding with wandb](https://gene46100.hakyimlab.org/post/2025-03-25-unit00/tf-binding-wandb)
- [ ] Document the hyperparameters you tuned and their impact on model performance

## Part 2: Model Deployment and Testing
- [ ] Upload your complete Jupyter notebook containing:
  - Model architecture
  - Training code
  - Evaluation metrics
  - Prediction code
- [ ] Include a separate, self-contained prediction script that:
  - Loads all required packages
  - Loads the trained model architecture and weights
  - Makes predictions on the hold-out test set
  - Can be run independently without executing the entire notebook

## Submission Requirements
1. Submit your Jupyter notebook with all code and documentation
2. Include a separate prediction script as described above
3. Document your hyperparameter tuning process and results
4. Provide clear instructions for running the prediction script

## Evaluation Criteria
- Proper implementation of hyperparameter tuning
- Model performance on test set
- Code organization and documentation
- Reproducibility of results
